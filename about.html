<p> I would like to raise awareness about <b>Mental Health issues</b> in African teens and youths since some of our African parents do not believe in such things and say that mental health issues exists in whites only.
i would like to prove the myth wrong and save depressed teens and youths so that it reaches a time where we can hear zero death rates about teens and youths commiting suicide because of mental health.</p>
