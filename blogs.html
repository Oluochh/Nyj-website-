<P> Born a crime is a story about a boy who grows in South Africa born in a world where he was never supposed to be because of his skin colour,its also a story of a young mans's relationship with his fearless,rebellious mother a woman determined to save her son from poverty,abuse and violence that would threaten her own life.
    The stories in born a crime turns out to be hilarious,dramatic and deeply affecting ,from being thrown from a moving car,eating caterpillars for dinner during hard times when they had nothing to put on their table,the funny part being able to survive the life and death pitfalls of dating in highschool.
The author's stories forms and portraits a boy making his way through a damaged world in a dangerous time surviving with only a keen sense of humour and a mother's unconditional Love </P>
<p><b>BLOG 1</b></p>
<P>In Trevor Noah's Book born a crime ,we see that <b>Abel</b> Trevor Noah's step dad wanted a traditional wife with a traditional marriage in which traditional wifes were required to be submissive to their husband ,stay at home and wait for the husbands to provide for them.
But according to the book we see that <b>Patricia Nombuyiselo</b> is vice versa to what Abel wanted ,Patricia was an independent woman who did not care about gender roles because according to Abel culture <b>"Tsonga"</b>men are not allowed to do any work ,reffering to Trevor his mum expected him to make his own bed but the culture did not allow him to do so and the mum was told about it.
Patricia was doing what was not expected and Abel did not like it so he saw that his wife was disrespecting him and thats when he started abusing Trevor Noah's mum by physically abusing her and almost killing her.</P>

<h3>HUMOUR IN BORN A CRIME</h3>
<P><b>Humour</b>is the ability to make someone laugh especially expressed in speech or literature style.</P>
<p>Trevor used humour in many ways but i will focus on how he used humour to make friends and escape in difficult situations.
    On a sunday,when they had no means of transport they aboarded a bus which turned out that they were the only people together with the driver,they told them that they were going to teach them a lesson since Trevors mum had already harrased them with words and to add on that he was a Xhosa woman ,Trevors mum told Trevor to prepare for they were going to jump of the bus when it was not moving at a high speed but Trevor did not hear since he was half asleep,so the mum decided to push him off the moving bus and they ran,when they reached at a safer spot she asked his mother why she pushed him,in real sense his mom told him that to prepare for they will jump when the bus slowed down its pace.
</p>
<p>The ability of Trevor speaking other tribes i.e"zulu,xhosa" helped him escape a dificult situation at the point where he was walking and a group of zulu guys were walkig behind him and talking about how they are going to mug him ,he turned back and speaked to them in zulu telling them why not mug someone together,they were shocked.</p>
<p>In making friends that Trevor thought he was making but they appeared to be bullies and thieves was really funny like  there was an incident where he had a bike and a coloured girl approached him for a ride ,Trevor was willing to give out his bike since he thought hat he was making a new friend ,little did he know that he was being robbed,infact Trevor was happy that a girl had spoken to him.
